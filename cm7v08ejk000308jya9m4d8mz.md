**Q1 (Jan - March)**

My progress in learning the Nigerian language Yoruba, in all honesty has been around 1/10. I have been making progress with a few words, so I can tell you the difference between Omobirin and Omokunrin; I can tell you lori meji mẹta (one, two, three) as I have been using the app Ling, a thai based language learning app to support me on my journey.

The progress I will say has been slow mainly because I am able to learn a few words, but possibly the slowness is due to the fact that I am using an app solely to learn. I do not for instance currently watch Nigerian films with Yoruba subtitles; and I am yet to have discussions with native Yoruba people.

**Luckily… 😄**

The best way to make progress is to pivot when things don’t go to plan. I hope to now learn using YouTube videos which I find online. Also, and an acquaintance let me know about an app they she uses to learn called Lingawa (formerly X). The app connects members of to Nigerian linguists to help them with their journey.

**So…**

Although I’m not oga ede yoruba (*the master of the yoruba language)* I’m making slow but steady progress which is better than none 💪🏾🔥
