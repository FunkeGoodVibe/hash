I really enjoy reading the Bible Stories Dev stories. The website translates bible stories into something that can be understood by developers. They use a range of languages to tell the stories. And the website was developed by Matt Lacey.

A story which I found funny was the story about the parable of the lost sheep. Where in the original parable, the Shepherd searches desperately for their lost sheep, the Bible stories for developers analogy gives us a the similar scenario where there was a piece of software with 100 features and the developer persisted to fixing their bug.

Where the shepherd was overjoyed when he found his sheep in the Bible, the software developer was overjoyed when they fixed their bug.

The excerpt ends by saying that writing good code is good, but there is more joy when a sinner repents. Very interesting stories! üêë
