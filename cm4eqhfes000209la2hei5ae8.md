## Introduction

I recently attended SONA's App Showcase. As someone who had not heard of the SONA app before attending, I approached the event with an open mind. I discovered that SONA, which stands for "School of New Africa," is an app designed to educate young people about their history by sharing knowledge from African historians. Additionally, the app provides financial literacy by teaching young people how to manage their money using a Mastercard app.

## Hosts

The founders and hosts were musician FUSE ODG and Andrew Hackett. I was inspired by the passion both co-founders had for their project. It was immediately evident how much hard work and perseverance went into the SONA app as they began to speak about its objectives and their motivation to create the app to address a customer problem they identified. There was also a lot of humor, mixed with pain, as Fuse ODG explained his challenges relocating from Africa to the UK—where he excelled in his studies but was discouraged from being proud of his African roots, even being urged to change his name to something more English-sounding to fit in. These stories, among others, were very engaging and made it easy to understand the drive behind the initiative.
