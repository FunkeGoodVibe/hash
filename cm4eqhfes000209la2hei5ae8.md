## Introduction

I recently attended SONA's App Showcase. As someone who had not heard of the SONA app before attending, I approached the event with an open mind. I discovered that SONA, which stands for "School of New Africa," is an app designed to educate young people about their history by sharing knowledge from African historians. Additionally, the app provides financial literacy by teaching young people how to manage their money using a Mastercard app.

## Hosts

The founders and hosts were musician FUSE ODG and Andrew Hackett. I was inspired by the passion both co-founders had for their project. It was immediately evident how much hard work and perseverance went into the SONA app as they began to speak about its objectives and their motivation to create the app to address a customer problem they identified. There was also a lot of humor, mixed with pain, as Fuse ODG explained his challenges relocating from Africa to the UK—where he excelled in his studies but was discouraged from being proud of his African roots, even being urged to change his name to something more English-sounding to fit in. These stories, among others, were very engaging and made it easy to understand the drive behind the initiative.

## Key Highlights of the Showcase

There was a live demo of the SONA app. The *main character* in the SONA app is a boy called “Ananse”. He is the cartoon character who guides the user on the journey of discovery of African History, Culture, Language and also money management. The app starts with a film clip where Ananse teaches the user on topics such as LOVE, KNOWLEDGE and POWER. The user then is presented with a quiz to test their knowledge before launching the app.

I really like the interactivity, storytelling and gameplay of the SONA app. I think this is the first time I’ve seen something like this, specifically targeting young African’s to learn about African history and money.

Core Themes:

* ### `LOVE - Use the SONA daily affirmation tracker to build your confidence over time and take on the world.`
    
* ### `KNOWLEDGE - Discover hidden history, culture and language and transform deserts through missions.`
    
* ### `POWER - Collect money & resources in-app and track spending, using your SONA cardApp #1 – Brief description and functionality.`
    

### Technical (?)

I was intrigued to learn more about the technical aspects of the SONA app. I was later informed that the app was implemented by a development team based in Ghana. I wasn’t able to ask *all* of the technical questions such as “how were the storylines for Ananse’s journey developed” or “what challenges did the development team in Ghana face, when implementing the app” etc. In hindsight, it’s understandable that these questions were not covered because I think this was an app showcase for potential investors and end-users!

## Conclusion

I personally found it very inspiring that founders Fuse ODG was able to capitalise on his *own* experience of a young black person moving from Ghana to the UK to inspire the SONA App. He proactively did not accept neglecting his heritage as an African as he

not and Andrew Hackett were able to use

implement a solution to a problem that was authentic, very personal and has a desire to have meaningful long term impact. I really like that the app was designed to be fun, and used stories to draw the user to learn more in a very simple way.
