Here are my takeaways from Candidly Vivian’s recent blog regarding building multiple streams of income, when working as a Data Scientist.

> Financial freedom isn’t about *working harder* - it’s about *working smarter* and shifting your mindset to build wealth.

* 💲Income #1) Full time job (data scientist) - 65% of total income (earned income).
    
* 💲Income #2) Side Jobs (teaching, etc) - ~2% of total income
    
* 💲Income #3) Investments - ~7% of total income
    
* 💲Income #4) Dividends - ~4% of total income.
    
* 💲Income #5) Interest - ~14% of total income.
    
* 💲Income #6) Google Adsense - ~1.5% of total income.
    
* 💲Income #7) Brand Sponsorships - ~3.5% of total income.
    
* 💲Income #8) Freelance content creation - ~3% of total income.
    

### Vivian’s Lessons

* 🤝 Lesson 1) Your time and energy is limited - spend them wisely.
    
* 🤝Lesson 2) It’s not about how much money you make, but how you manage your income.
    
* 🤝Lesson 3) You don’t need a side hustle (if you are under 25) - focus on increasing your earned income 
    
* 🤝Lesson 4) You don’t have to come from wealth, to start building wealth - stop making excuses. 
    
* 🤝Lesson 5) Stop surrounding yourself with the wrong people. i.e. poor mindset or financial habits.
    

Final Quote:

> You are the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with.
