As someone of African heritage who was born and raised in the UK, I recently thought - wouldn’t it be “fun” to learn my parents' language for the first time. I missed the opportunity to learn it as a child. However, with apps like 'Ling' offering Yoruba language tutorials and websites such as Live Lingua offering a fully virtual Yoruba class, learning the language is now very accessible :).

The significance of learning Yoruba consistently over 100 days+ is that it allows you to achieve goals by creating new habits through perseverance and consistency. My goal by the end of the challenge is to be comfortable holding basic conversations as well as writing confidently in Yoruba. The main tools that I hope to use are currently Ling, and Live Lingua. If I find additional tools along the way, I will use these too. I also hope that there will be a pool of Nigerians that will be happy to serve as my language exchange partner to help quicken the learning journey!

Although I’ve titled this “100 days of learning Yoruba” - I’m hoping to use the hashnode platform to track my progress… hopefully to also keep me accountable too 😂.

So… let’s “jeka lo”! 🇳🇬
