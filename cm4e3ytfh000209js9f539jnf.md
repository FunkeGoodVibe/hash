As a person of African heritage - and born and raised in the UK as an adult I started to think‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt it be great to learn my parents language? I never got a chance to learn as a child. However, with apps such an ‚ÄòLing‚Äô that now include the Yoruba language providing tutorials, plus freely available articles online it is now more accessible for individuals to learn a wider range of languages, online üéâ.

I personally think it will be good to learn because in an age where there are so many ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù to learn from CoffeeScript to X.. I hope it will be fun to learn which is my motivation when learning new things.
